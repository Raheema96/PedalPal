Project Title: PedalPal Dashboard

Description:
This repository contains the sql code for a data-driven dashboard designed to provide actionable insights into the performance of a fictitious company PedalPal. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, such as hourly revenue, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue, and rider demographics.

Motivation:
The project was initiated in response to the following email request:

Dear data analyst,

We need your expertise to develop a dashboard for 'PedalPal' that displays our key performance metrics for informed decision-making.

Requirements:

hourly Revenue analysis
profit and revenue trends
seasonal revenue
rider demographics
Please provide recommendations on raising prices next year.

Dashboard Features:

Hourly Revenue Analysis: Visualised the hourly revenue fluctuations to identify peak times and potential pricing adjustments.
Profit and Revenue Trends: Tracked the overall financial health of PedalPal by comparing profit and revenue trends over time.
Seasonal Revenue: Analyzed revenue patterns throughout the year to understand seasonal variations and optimize pricing strategies.
Rider demographic: Visualised the rider segmentation to determine how many are registed vs those that are casual.

Tools:
Power BI: Used for data modeling, visualization, and interactive analysis.
SQL Server Management Studio: Used for data extraction and preparation.

Recommendations:

Conservative Increases: Given the substantial price hikes in 2022, a more cautious approach is advisable to avoid reaching a price ceiling. A gradual increase of 10-15% can assess market receptiveness without risking significant customer attrition.

Price Setting:
A 10% increase from $4.99 would result in a new price of approximately $5.49.
A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.

Recommended Strategy:
Market Analysis: Conduct thorough research to understand customer sentiment, competitive shifts, and overall economic landscape. This will guide the decision on whether to lean towards a lower or higher price increase.
Segmented Pricing: Implement tiered pricing for casual and registered users, as they may exhibit different price considerations.
Monitor and Adjust: Implement the new pricing but remain vigilant for immediate customer feedback and sales data. This will allow for timely adjustments to ensure optimal pricing.
